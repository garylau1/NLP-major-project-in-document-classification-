# üîê PII Detection in ID Documents using LLMs

This is a major project for **COMP8420 ‚Äì Advanced Natural Language Processing**, focused on enhancing identity verification systems by detecting and classifying **Personally Identifiable Information (PII)** and **non-PII** from OCR-extracted text in Australian driver's licenses using state-of-the-art **Large Language Models (LLMs)**.

---

## üöÄ Project Overview

With the rise of identity fraud, accurate classification of PII in ID documents is critical. This project benchmarks and fine-tunes several LLMs (Claude, LLaMA 4 Maverick, DeepSeek, Piiranha-v1) to improve both **accuracy** and **latency** in text extraction pipelines.

## üìÅ Dataset

- **319** real-world Australian driver's licenses
- Extracted using OCR and **pseudonymized** to protect privacy
- Each sample is manually annotated for **PII** and **non-PII** fields
